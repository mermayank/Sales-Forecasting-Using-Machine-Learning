# Sales-Forecasting-Using-Machine-Learning

This project focuses on predicting future sales using historical data and machine learning models. Accurate sales forecasting helps businesses make data-driven decisions related to inventory, marketing, and resource planning.

💡 Key Features

Data preprocessing and feature engineering for sales datasets

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualization of sales trends

Implementation of multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, etc.)

Time series forecasting using ARIMA or Prophet

Model evaluation using MAE, RMSE, and R² metrics

Predictive dashboard or Flask app (optional, if applicable)

🧰 Tech Stack

Languages: Python

Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, xgboost, statsmodels

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly

(Optional) Web Framework: Flask / Streamlit for UI
